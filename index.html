    <h1>EXP - Experimental Summer Workshop</h1>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">EXP is an experimental summer workshop combining
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">applied rationality with immersive experiential education</strong>. We create a space where theory meets practice through simulated scenarios, games, and structured experiences designed to develop both individual and collective capabilities and virtues.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67);">Core Focus Areas</h3>
<ul>
  <li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">
    <h3>Collective intelligence: How can groups think clearly together?</h3>
  </li>
  <li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">
    <h3>Individual and group virtues: How can we trust ourselves and others?</h3>
  </li>
  <li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">
    <h3>AI: How can current or future AI systems empower humans individually and collectively?</h3>
  </li>
  <li style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">
    <h3>Memetics: What shapes culture and what culture do we want?</h3>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67);">Our Approach</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">EXP will have classes and talks, but is largely based on learning through experience: games, simulations, and adventure. And reflection.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The process—called experiential education—emphasizes the value of experimentation, curiosity-led exploration and the role of strong experiences in a safe environment to boost learning.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We are trying to bridge the gap between the theoretical understanding and the practical application of ideas regarding topics of collective intelligence, virtue and sound epistemics. In the morning we may discuss how groups navigate epistemically tricky situations, in the afternoon experience it in a role-playing game.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The programme will make you think, and feel. It will nurture your curiosity as well as provide space for applying knowledge and practicing skills you already have. It will enable you to learn more about yourself and how to better interact with others.</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(67, 67, 67);">FAQ</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">When:</strong>20. – 27. 6. 2025</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Where:</strong>In the beautiful Czech countryside in the Jeseníky mountains. The meeting point will be in Prague around noon on the 20th of June.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Who should apply?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Everyone interested in the topics of agency, collective intelligence or virtue, who is also excited about participating in a playful summer camp for adults. Everyone who wants to understand themselves and the world better through experiences, simulations and learning from others. Everyone interested in group rationality and memetics, who wants to test and experience these ideas in practice.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The event is experimental: we want to develop and test new content. Not everything might click on the first try, but we want to keep on innovating and build upon our decades of experience of running camps, experiential events and teaching.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">What is the motivation behind the program?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">The background of the organizing team lies in alignment research, rationality education, complex systems, and creating games and LARPs.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We are interested in the topics of collective intelligence, coordination, group virtues, and their connection to the future of AI development.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Many of us benefited from participating in experiential events. We think experiential education and simulations are unique tools for learning and transmitting knowledge as it is a playground both for participants and facilitators.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We hope the event will increase everyone’s understanding of the topics involved and will give us ideas for new projects and promising approaches for related important challenges.</p>

</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">What will the event look like?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We will spend a week together, learning, playing, running, thinking, creating, discussing and simulating different situations. Some activities will take place outdoors or during the night, however, all participation is voluntary and no activities depend on high physical fitness. Generally, we strive to create a safe environment conducive of learning.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">What is the price?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We expect 300 – 700 EUR depending on participants’ situation and the availability of external funding. We might be able to provide scholarship and travel support, pending the availability of funding. If you need support, please indicate so in the application form.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">What is included in the price?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">6.5 days of program day and night, facilitators, equipment for various activities, all-inclusive food and accommodation on site. What is not included are your travel expenses to and from Prague, and medical insurance, if you need it (EU nationals are covered).</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Who are going to be the participants?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">We expect about 25 participants mostly between the ages 20-35 with the median age around 23-25. You can of course apply even if you are older than 35, but you should expect that an average participant is going to be younger than you. You can apply if you are younger than 20, but you need to be over 18 at the beginning of the event.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Is it possible to work part-time from the event?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">No. The workshop requires full attention of both participants and facilitators. Experiential events work the best when participants can fully immerse themselves in the environment.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Will there be enough time to sleep and rest?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">Yes.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">What if someone is afraid and does not want to participate in some activities?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">All participation is voluntary and there will always be the option to withdraw from any particular activity.</p>
<p>
  <strong style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">What does EXP mean?</strong>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);">EXP stands for Experience, Exploration and Experiment.</p>
